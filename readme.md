# Xeroq
XeroQ is a smart queue management web app for college xerox centers. It allows students to upload documents online, select print options like color or B&amp;W, and receive a secure OTP. Xerox staff can enter this OTP on the admin panel to instantly retrieve and print the document â€” reducing crowd, wait time, and manual work.
